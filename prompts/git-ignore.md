## Git Ignore

# Core
_model_ : GPT-4

Based on the project details provided, generate a **`.gitignore`** file that adheres to the following principles:

1. **Language Specific Artifacts**: Exclude files and folders typically generated by the build process of the specific programming language or framework in use.
2. **Development Tools**: If any specific development tools, IDEs, or code editors are mentioned, exclude typical configuration and cache files they might generate.
3. **Environment Specific Files**: Ignore OS-specific files like **`.DS_Store`** for macOS or **`Thumbs.db`** for Windows.
4. **Sensitive Information**: Ensure that any configuration files or environment files containing secrets, API keys, or passwords are excluded.
5. **Dependency Artifacts**: For languages that use dependency management tools (e.g., **`node_modules`** for JavaScript, **`venv`** for Python), ensure the resulting directories/files are excluded.
6. **Build Artifacts**: Exclude any compiled files, log files, or binary assets generated during the build process.
7. **Cache and Temporary Files**: Exclude temporary files, cache directories, and other transient data.
8. **Database Files**: If there's a local database, its data and log files should be excluded to prevent inconsistency across development environments.
9. **User-specific Files**: Exclude any user-specific configuration or temporary files.
10. **Avoid Negations**: Instead of negating ignored files (using **`!`**), structure the **`.gitignore`** so it's clear what's ignored without needing exceptions when possible.

Given the project's stack and tools, which include **`[LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES, LANGUAGES, FRAMEWORKS, AND TOOLS]`**, please generate an appropriate **`.gitignore`** file.
